# Bulls-and-Cows

Cows and Bulls is a pen-and-paper code-breaking game. The rules are as follows:
1️⃣ The computer generates a 4-digit secret code. And the number has no repeated digits.
2️⃣ You are supposed to guess the 4-digit secret code. Upon making a guess, 2 hints will be provided - COWS and BULLS.
3️⃣ Bulls indicate the number of correct digits in the correct position and cows indicate the number of correct digits in the wrong position. For example, if the secret code is 1234 and the guessed number is 1246 then we have 2 BULLS (for the exact matches of digits 1 and 2) and 1 COW (for the match of digit 4 in the wrong position).
4️⃣ The player keeps on guessing until the secret code is cracked
